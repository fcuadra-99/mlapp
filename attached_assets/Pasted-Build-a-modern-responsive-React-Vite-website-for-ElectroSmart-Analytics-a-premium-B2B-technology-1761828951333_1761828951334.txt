Build a modern, responsive React (Vite) website for ElectroSmart Analytics, a premium B2B technology company that helps electronics retailers optimize sales, inventory, and customer engagement through AI-powered analytics.

Use Tailwind CSS for styling, MagicUI components for animations/visuals, and React Router for navigation between pages. All components must follow a modular folder structure for clarity and scalability.

Include the following features and deliverables:

🧭 Routes (React Router)

/ → Home

/about → About

/gallery → Gallery

/insights → Insights

/blog → Blog

/contact → Contact

/services → Services hub (index)

/services/sales-forecasting → SalesForecasting page

/services/customer-segmentation → CustomerSegmentation page

/services/product-recommendation → ProductRecommendation page

/services/fraud-detection → FraudDetection page

🧩 Reusable Components (specs)

Navbar (component folder): sticky, responsive, logo, links to all pages, a Services dropdown with links to the four service subpages, CTA button “Request Demo”. Use smooth scrolling and active link highlighting.

Footer: minimal site links and social icons.

AnimatedStats: animated counters (e.g., “95% prediction accuracy”, “+30% sales growth”, “120+ clients”) using MagicUI or framer-motion.

Button: reusable button component with variants (primary, ghost).

ScrollReveal: HOC or wrapper to add entrance animations to any section.

🎨 Design & Styling

Use Tailwind CSS and Tailwind utilities exclusively for layout and styling; keep styles modular.

Colors: dark slate (#0f172a), accent blue (#2563eb), cyan (#38bdf8), light gray (#f3f4f6), white.

Font: “Inter” or “Outfit”.

Visual style: futuristic, professional — soft gradients, glass panels, subtle glows.

Use lucide-react for icons.

✨ Landing Page (Home.tsx) — Must include:

Hero section with headline: “Powering Smarter Decisions for Electronics Retail.”

Short mission paragraph.

CTA button to Contact.

Services preview with four cards linking to service subpages (Sales Forecasting, Customer Segmentation, Product Recommendation, Fraud Detection).

“Data in Action” gallery with mock charts (use placeholder images or small Recharts components).

About summary describing usage of the E-commerce Purchase History Dataset.

Why Choose Us + AnimatedStats.

Contact section/short form with CTA.

🔬 Services Subpages (each)

Each subpage must:

Reuse Navbar and Footer.

Have a hero/title for the service (e.g., “Sales Forecasting”).

Short explanation of the algorithm(s) used:

Sales Forecasting → Linear Regression

Customer Segmentation → Naive Bayes, Decision Tree

Product Recommendation → KNN, ANN

Fraud Detection → SVM

A sample/mock visualization area (chart or example prediction output).

Bullet list of real-world benefits for retailers.

Placeholder area for dataset info and methodology.

README.md in each service folder describing how to add real model code later.
